**Project Proposal: Credit Risk Assessment Using Ensemble Learning**

**Problem Statement:**

Financial institutions face significant challenges in accurately assessing the credit risk of potential borrowers. Traditional credit scoring models may not fully capture the complexities of borrower behavior, leading to suboptimal lending decisions. This project aims to develop a machine learning application that utilizes ensemble learning techniques to enhance the prediction accuracy of credit risk, thereby aiding financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.

**Deliverables:**

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Gather historical loan application data, including borrower demographics, financial information, and loan performance outcomes.
   - Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features to prepare the dataset for modeling.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create new features that may have predictive power, such as debt-to-income ratios, credit utilization rates, and employment stability indicators.

3. **Model Development:**
   - Implement various ensemble learning algorithms, including Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines, and XGBoost, to model credit risk.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **API Development:**
   - Develop a Django-based RESTful API that allows external systems to submit borrower information and receive credit risk assessments in real-time.

5. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the application on AWS using services such as Elastic Beanstalk or App Runner to ensure scalability and reliability.

**Tech Stack:**

- **Backend Framework:** Python with Django
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Database:** SQLite3, PostgreSQL
- **Deployment:** AWS Elastic Beanstalk or AWS App Runner

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Step 1: Data Preparation**
   - Collect and preprocess the dataset, ensuring it is suitable for modeling.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis to understand feature distributions and relationships.

2. **Step 2: Feature Engineering and Selection**
   - Engineer new features that could enhance model performance.
   - Select the most relevant features using techniques such as feature importance scores from preliminary models.

3. **Step 3: Model Training and Evaluation**
   - Train multiple ensemble models and evaluate their performance using cross-validation.
   - Tune hyperparameters to optimize model accuracy and robustness.

4. **Step 4: API Development and Deployment**
   - Develop the Django-based API to serve the model predictions.
   - Deploy the application on AWS, ensuring it meets performance and security standards.

**Uniqueness and Impact:**

By focusing on ensemble learning techniques, this project aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of credit risk assessments. Accurate credit risk prediction is crucial for financial institutions to minimize defaults and maintain profitability. Deploying the application on AWS ensures that it can handle real-time assessments and scale with demand, making it a valuable tool for lenders.
